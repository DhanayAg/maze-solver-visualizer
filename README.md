**🧩 Maze Solver Visualizer**

An interactive pathfinding visualizer built with React, allowing users to place walls, set start & end points, and visualize how different algorithms find the shortest path in real-time.

**🚀 Features**

✅ Visualizes BFS, DFS, and A* pathfinding algorithms
✅ Interactive grid customization (add/remove walls, change grid size)
✅ Start and End point placement with instant reset
✅ Real-time animated traversal of visited nodes & shortest path
✅ Mobile-friendly and responsive design


**🛠️ Tech Stack**

Frontend: React (functional components & hooks)
Styling: CSS (custom responsive design)
Deployment: Vercel (auto updates with every GitHub push)


**📌 How to Use**

    Set Start & End Points – Click on any two cells (first = start, second = end).
    Add Walls – Click on cells to make them walls (toggle on/off).
    Choose Algorithm – Click "Visualize BFS", "Visualize DFS", or "Visualize A*".
    Clear Path – Instantly clears the path (stops animation).
    Reset Grid – Resets everything, including walls and start/end points.


**🏗️ Installation & Setup (For Developers)**

Clone the repo and run locally:

git clone https://github.com/DhanayAg/maze-solver-visualizer.git
cd maze-solver-visualizer
npm install
npm start


**🎯 Algorithms Implemented**

🔹 BFS (Breadth-First Search)
    - Guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted grid.

🔹 DFS (Depth-First Search)
    - Explores deeper paths first (not always the shortest path).

🔹 A* Search Algorithm
    - Uses heuristics (Manhattan distance) to efficiently find the shortest path.
